Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)
  Harris-Benedict Equation
  Calories just to keep you alive

Thermic Effect of Food (TEF)
  Energy required to digest Food
  10% of Daily Energy Expenditure
  Katch-McArdle Multipliers
    Sedentary (little to no exercise + desk job) = 1.2
    Lightly Active (light exercise 1-3 days/week) = 1.375
    Moderately Active(moderate exercise 3-5 days/week) = 1.55
    Very Active (heavy exercise 6-7 days / week ) = 1.725
    Extremely Active (very heavy exercise, hard labor job, training 2x / day) = 1.9

Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT)
  Daily calories based on movement. 
  Job Types

Thermic Effect of Activity (TEA)
  calories burned from Exercise

Total Daily Energy Expenditure
  TDEE = BMR + TEF + NEAT + TEA

Consume 200-300 above TDEE
